# Task Completion Checklist

## Data Understanding & Preprocessing
- [x] Perform exploratory analysis of the dataset to understand customer purchasing patterns, product categories, and trends. (eda.ipynb)
- [x] Preprocess the data to make it suitable for querying and knowledge retrieval by an LLM. (customer_query_agent.py)
- [x] Generate embeddings or structured representations for products, categories, and customer profiles. (artifacts/preprocessed_data.json)

## LLM-Powered Query System
- [x] Build an AI agent capable of answering complex customer-related queries. (customer_query_agent.py)
    - [x] "Which products does Customer_X frequently purchase in the Beverages category?"
    - [x] "Suggest products that are usually bought together by high-value customers."
    - [x] "Identify unusual or unique buying patterns in the last 3 months."
- [x] Use LLMs for natural language understanding and integrate with the dataset to generate accurate responses. (Gemini 2.5 Flash via google-genai; see artifacts/sample_responses.json)
- [x] Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or vector database search for structured data interaction. (knowledge_base.json)

## Advanced Features (Challenge)
- [x] Implement reasoning across multiple dimensions.
    - [x] Temporal patterns (seasonality, recency of purchases).
    - [x] Category hierarchies (Broad_Category -> Product_Category -> Product_Sub_Category).
    - [x] Customer segmentation insights.
- [x] Allow the system to answer questions in natural language using these insights. (artifacts/sample_responses.json)

## Evaluation
- [x] Evaluate the system for accuracy, relevance, and contextual understanding. (report.md)
- [x] Provide example queries and responses to demonstrate reasoning ability. (artifacts/sample_responses.json)
- [x] Optionally, benchmark using embedding similarity scores or precision/recall of retrieved information. (artifacts/benchmark_results.json)

## Deliverables
- [x] A Jupyter Notebook or Python script demonstrating the LLM-powered query system. (eda.ipynb, customer_query_agent.py)
- [x] A 2-3-page report summarizing:
    - [x] Data preprocessing and embedding strategies.
    - [x] Model architecture and approach for query handling.
    - [x] Evaluation results and system capabilities.
    - [x] Example interactions (questions and answers) to showcase system performance.

## Optional Bonus Challenge
- [ ] Allow the system to generate product recommendations dynamically based on query context.
- [ ] Integrate reasoning across multiple customers or categories to answer more complex queries.
