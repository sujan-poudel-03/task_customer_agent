    "question": "Identify unusual buying patterns in the last 3 months.",
    "answer": "Here are the unusual buying patterns observed in the last 3 months, based on significant shifts in category spending:\n\n*   **Dramatic increase in Food category share for new spenders:**\n    *   Bonnie Garrett's Food share increased to **14%** from a previous **0%**.\n    *   Joseph Noble's Food share increased to **46%** from a previous **0%**.\n    *   Steven Richardson's Food share increased to **61%** from a previous **6%**. (heuristic_answer)\n*   **Significant increase in Household category share for a new spender:**\n    *   Jack Williamson's Household share increased to **55%** from a previous **0%**. (heuristic_answer)\n*   **Notable increases in Food category share for existing customers:**\n    *   Lindsey Glass's Food share increased to **87%** from **22%**, representing a **4.02x change ratio**. (supporting_facts)\n    *   Diana Rojas's Food share increased to **48%** from **15%**, representing a **3.26x change ratio**. (supporting_facts)\n    *   David Collins's Food share increased to **67%** from **32%**, representing a **2.08x change ratio**. (supporting_facts)\n    *   Jorge Morris's Food share increased to **20%** from **3%**, representing a **6.64x change ratio**. (retrieved_records)\n*   **Significant increase in Household category share for an existing customer:**\n    *   Patrick Robinson's Household share increased to **34%** from **16%**, representing a **2.2x change ratio**. (supporting_facts)\n    *   Pamela Tran's Household share increased to **14%** from **3%**, representing a **5.35x change ratio**. (retrieved_records)\n*   **Significant increase in Beverage category share:**\n    *   Brian Turner's Beverage share increased to **24%** from **2%**. (heuristic_answer)\n    *   Thomas Williams's Beverage share increased to **18%** from **3%**, representing a **5.62x change ratio**. (retrieved_records)\n\n**Information Insufficiency and Next Steps:**\n\nThe provided context highlights specific customer-category shifts. However, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of \"unusual buying patterns,\" the following would be beneficial:\n\n*   **Definition of \"Unusual\":** A clear, quantitative definition of \"unusual\" (e.g., a specific percentage increase, a change ratio threshold, or a deviation from a historical average) would allow for more precise identification. Currently, the heuristic answer and supporting facts imply different thresholds.\n*   **Contextual Baselines:** For customers with a \"previous share\" of 0%, it's unclear if this represents a new customer, a customer who previously didn't buy in that category, or a data anomaly. Understanding this context would help interpret the significance of these 0% to >0% changes.\n*   **Order Frequency and Volume:** While share change is noted, understanding the absolute number of orders, average order value, and quantity purchased for these categories before and after the shift would provide more robust insights into the magnitude of the change.\n*   **Temporal Granularity:** \"Last 3 months\" is a broad period. Knowing if these changes were sudden spikes, gradual increases, or consistently high new purchasing would add depth.\n*   **Peer Group Comparison:** Comparing these customers' buying patterns against similar customer segments or the overall customer base would help determine if these shifts are truly anomalous or part of a broader trend.\n*   **Reasoning for Changes:** The current data identifies *what* changed, but not *why*. Investigating potential external factors (promotions, product availability, life events, etc.) would be valuable.",
