    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the customer who purchases the most in terms of total revenue is **Melissa Montgomery**, with a total revenue of **$6,187.15**. This is followed by Lindsey Glass ($5,755.33) and Wesley Hart ($5,338.33).\n\nIn terms of total quantity, **Adam Johnson** has the highest total quantity of purchases at **99 units**, closely followed by Melissa Montgomery (96 units) and Wesley Hart (92 units).\n\nThe dataset includes 50 unique customers.\n\n**Information Insufficient:**\nThe provided context includes a \"heuristic_answer\" mentioning \"Jorge Morris\" who \"frequently buys Household items. Top picks: Product 40 (14), Product 31 (10), Product 35 (10). Total spend $3,332 across 20 orders (avg ticket $167).\" However, Jorge Morris is not present in the \"top_customers\" list, and the \"heuristic_answer\" does not specify if this refers to the most frequent purchases by count or value across all customers, or just for a specific individual. Therefore, without further context on Jorge Morris's overall spending or quantity relative to the top customers provided, it's not possible to definitively state if Jorge Morris \"purchases the most\" overall.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nTo fully answer \"who purchases the most,\" we would need the total revenue and total quantity for *all* customers, not just the top 10 provided in the \"top_customers\" list, and clarification on whether \"most\" refers to revenue, quantity, or frequency of orders. If Jorge Morris is a key customer, his total revenue and quantity should be included in the `top_customers` list for comparison.",
